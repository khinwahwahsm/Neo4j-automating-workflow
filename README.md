# Neo4j-automating-workflow

###

<h2 align="left">Description</h2>

###

<p align="left">The client is a SaaS product that enables businesses to collaborate through multi-party workflows. The objective of this project,  Autocomplete for Business Workflows, is to develop a predictive model that auto-completes the next step in these workflows. The methodology includes developing an ETL pipeline, creating a Neo4j database, and building a frequency analysis model. The final output is a Python function that predicts the next user to be invited to a workflow step. Despite this progress, limitations remain, such as not considering the recency of invitations and user characteristics. Recommendations for improvement include enhancing project approach and accuracy, incorporating network analysis, utilizing segmentation analysis, and conducting temporal analysis.</p>

<h3 align="left">Project Details</h3>

###

<p align="left">A workflow consists of multiple steps, and each of them belongs to a person in charge. Once<br>the pic of a particular step is done, they will have to send an invitation to the pic of the next<br>step. The invited user will then come into the workflow to work on their respective steps. Now,<br>users have to type in the invited user’s email address manually - and our client is looking to<br>enhance this process. As a solution to increase efficiency, they would like to auto-fill the invitation text box with the email address of the suggested user. The project’s objective is to develop a model to suggest these users.</p>
